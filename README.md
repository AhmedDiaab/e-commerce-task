Task: E-commerce Product Listing and Search API with Node.js

Requirements:
1. Develop a RESTful API for managing product listings and search functionality using Node.js.
2. Allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete product listings.
3. Implement validation checks for the product information (e.g., title, description, price, image).
4. Support search functionality to allow users to find products based on different criteria (e.g., title, category, price range).
5. Implement pagination and sorting options for the product listings.
6. Use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store product information.
7. Implement error handling and logging for the API.
8. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of the API endpoints.
9. Implement input sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
10. Implement rate limiting or other security measures to protect against abuse or denial-of-service attacks.

Details:
1. Create a new Node.js project with a suitable name.
2. Set up the project dependencies and package.json file.
3. Create an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests.
4. Define routes for product listing CRUD operations (e.g., create, retrieve, update, delete) with the appropriate HTTP methods and endpoints.
5. Implement middleware to validate the product information, ensuring all required fields are provided and meet the necessary criteria.
6. Connect to the chosen database and set up the required schemas or tables to store product information.
7. Implement the necessary endpoints and logic to handle product search based on different criteria (e.g., title, category, price range).
8. Implement pagination and sorting options for the product listings to improve usability.
9. Handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.
10. Set up logging to record API activities and errors.
11. Write unit tests using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to verify the functionality of the API endpoints.
12. Implement input sanitization using a library or custom middleware to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
13. Add rate limiting or other security measures to protect against abuse or denial-of-service attacks.
14. Document the API endpoints, their input/output format, and any required headers or authentication mechanisms.

Note: Remember to install any required Node.js packages, adhere to coding best practices, and use proper error handling techniques throughout the development process. Additionally, ensure the API is secure, scalable, and optimized for performance.
